- Look at your distributions. This means understanding the shape of your data, such as whether it is normally distributed or skewed.
- Consider the outliers. Outliers are data points that fall outside the normal range. They can be important clues to understanding your data, but they can also be the result of errors.
- Consider noise. Noise is random variation in your data. It can make it difficult to see patterns, but it can also be important information.
- Look at examples. Sometimes the best way to understand your data is to look at specific examples. This can help you to identify patterns and outliers.
- Slice your data. This means dividing your data into smaller groups. This can help you to see patterns that would not be visible if you looked at the data as a whole.
- Consider practical significance. This means thinking about whether the patterns you see in your data are actually meaningful. Just because something is statistically significant does not mean that it is important in the real world.
- Check for consistency over time. This means looking at your data to see if the patterns you see are consistent over time. If they are not, then you may need to investigate further.
- Acknowledge and count your filtering. This means being aware of the fact that you are making choices about which data to include in your analysis. These choices can affect the results of your analysis, so it is important to be aware of them.
- Ratios should have clear numerator and denominators. This means that when you are calculating ratios, you should be clear about what is in the numerator and what is in the denominator. This will help to ensure that your results are accurate.
- Make hypotheses and look for evidence. This means developing theories about what your data is telling you and then looking for evidence to support or refute those theories.
