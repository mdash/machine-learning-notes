From the article "Rules of Machine Learning" on the Google Developers website:
* Rule #1: Don't be afraid to launch a product without machine learning.
* Rule #2: Start with a small model.
* Rule #3: Don't overfit your model.
* Rule #4: Use cross-validation to evaluate your model.
* Rule #5: Use a holdout set to evaluate your model's performance on unseen data.
* Rule #6: Monitor your model's performance in production.
* Rule #7: Be prepared to retrain your model as your data changes.
* Rule #8: Don't trust your model too much.
* Rule #9: Be transparent about your model's limitations.
* Rule #10: Be ethical in your use of machine learning.

Few other snippets:
* Data is king. The quality and quantity of your data will have a major impact on the performance of your machine learning model.
* Choose the right algorithm for the job. There are many different machine learning algorithms available, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Choose the algorithm that is best suited for your problem.
* Don't overfit your model. Overfitting occurs when your model learns the training data too well and is unable to generalize to new data. To avoid overfitting, use cross-validation or a holdout set to evaluate your model's performance on unseen data.
* Regularize your model. Regularization is a technique that can help to prevent overfitting. There are many different regularization techniques available, and the best technique for you will depend on your problem.
* Get more data. More data is always better when it comes to machine learning. If your model is not performing well, try getting more data.
* Don't trust your model too much. Machine learning models are not perfect. They can make mistakes. It is important to be aware of the limitations of your model and to not trust it too much.
* Be transparent about your model's limitations. It is important to be transparent about the limitations of your model with your users. This will help them to understand the limitations of the model and to make informed decisions about how to use it.
* Be ethical in your use of machine learning. Machine learning can be a powerful tool, but it is important to use it ethically. Be sure to consider the potential impact of your model on others before deploying it.

In addition to these rules, there are a few other things to keep in mind when working with machine learning models:

* Machine learning is a process. It takes time and effort to build a good machine learning model. Don't expect to get it right the first time.
* Machine learning is iterative. You will need to experiment with different models and parameters to find the best solution for your problem.
* Machine learning is a team sport. It is important to work with a team of experts who can help you with all aspects of the machine learning process, from data collection to model evaluation.
